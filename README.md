# MATH340_Programming_In_Math_Assignments
This content comes from a course at SDSU called "MATH 340 - Programming in Math." The course introduces mathematical programming and covers modeling, problem solving, and visualization. The language that is used in this course is Python 2. I am currently creating a Python 3 version of this repository.
